Welcome to my Portfolio on github, I will be updating this page accordingly to showcase my work and skills.

## About Me

I am a single father that finds coding as fun as playing a video game, creating and building out my ideas is something that has always been my passion. I love to create and build new things, or take apart and find out whats going on. You can see my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Jesustellor) account. or Visit my [Website](https://jesustellor.github.io) to see my portfolio and my projects from a different angle.
